My name is Niall Barber and I'm a front-end developer with over five years experience working in multiple different environments. I currently work for a software house, making an app in-house but have also worked for agencies for around three years in the past.

I primarily work with React, Typescript, Redux and styled components, but also have experience in Vue, Svelte and React Native. I also have personal experience of back end technologies such as Node, GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL and Rust. 

Check out some of my doodles and more...formulated doodles :relaxed:
