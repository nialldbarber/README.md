My name is Niall Barber and I'm a front-end developer with 5+ years experience working in multiple different environments. I currently work for a software house, making an app in-house but have also worked for agencies for around three years in the past.

I primarily work with <span style="color:#61dafb">React</span>, Typescript, Redux and styled components, but also have experience in Vue, Svelte and React Native. I also have personal experience of back end technologies such as Node, GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL and Rust. 

Check out some of my doodles :relaxed:
